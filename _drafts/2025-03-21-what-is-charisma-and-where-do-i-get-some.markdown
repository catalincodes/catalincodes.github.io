# Here's what you need to do to become charismatic

What do we think about when we think about charismatic? Someone like: Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Pedro Pascal, Gary Vaynerchuk, Barrack Obama. Right? What makes these people special? What is charisma? We call charismatic the people who have this innate ability, this way, not just of talking, but of being such that it makes us more susceptible to accept their views and be more inclined to do what they suggest. In 2025 terms: charismatic people are simply put more influential. 

How does it work? It's quite simple, actually. Charisma is a recipe with three main ingredients: presence, confidence and authenticity. Other things go in there and may be helpful like communication skills, emotional intelligence, positivity, but those three are the most important ones. And guess what, I will go through each one of them. 

## Presence

Let's envision meeting two people one after the other. I won't tell you who you met first, because as you will see, it really it makes little difference. One person talks to us, but they constantly talk about themselves. Then, when we talk to them, they check their phones. They don't look at us. They always look around the room, never looking us in our eyes and they are constantly fidgeting. The other person is different. They listen to everything we say, looking in our eyes from time to time. They ask probing questions and they feel like they really want to know more about what we have to say. Then when it's their time to speak, they do not go on in monologues. They express their views and then they pass the proverbial torch right back to us. They take that proverbial torch and brighten our very day.

It's clear which one of the two has more presence, if not, well let me help you: it's the second one. When we talk to someone who is present with us they make us feel seen and heard. We feel valued and that is one of the three items that makes someone charismatic.
