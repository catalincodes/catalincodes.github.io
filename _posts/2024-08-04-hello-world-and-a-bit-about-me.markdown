Hi, there, my name is Catalin Codes (not my real name, except, I guess, for Catalin). I'm a developer from Canada with a little over 5 years of experience in the .NET ecosystem. I'm passionate about transforming ideas into code and I've been doing it for what feels like forever now. I'm passionate about everything .NET, C#, Blazor, API.

### From Gaming to Growth

My journey with programming started very early at the age of four when my dad introduced me to a computer. What started as an obsession with playing games (like Grand Prix Circuit, Pac-Man or Mah Jong) on the PC, turned in a different direction when I got curious in how things work. By the age of 6 I was already tinkering with the MS-DOS operating system making my own rudimentary scripts. 

Beyond the code, I'm on a journey of continous personal growth. The same way we talk about CI-CD, continous integration and continous development, in the software world I believe that we humans should also continously integrate our experience and develop ourselves. This, right here, is my personal digital playground, where I will share my experiences, insights, tips, you name it.

### At the corner of Code Street and Personal Growth Avenue

I've always found an interesting, this parallel between developing software projects and our own personal growth. Both require a problem-solving mindset, relentless curiosity, and a persistent drive for improvement. Just like debugging a complex issue, overcoming personal challenges often involves breaking down problems into smaller, manageable steps.

I remember the time I spent countless hours troubleshooting a particularly stubborn bug? Or the stress that went into making my first homemade bread without a breadmaker? Both were frustrating, stressful, and utterly nerve-wracking experiences. But in both cases, the joy of seeing something come alive — whether it's a perfectly functioning application or a delicious loaf of bread—made it all worthwhile. As the old adage goes, "No pain, no gain." Kind of like this blog post, I suppose.

I'm sure you, fellow blog-reader, have undergone similar scenarios where you've put a lot of effort into something. You've probably felt like giving up multiple times, but when you finally pulled it off, you felt amazing. I remember learning to rollerblade when I was young, learning to drive, making a grocery list generator in Python, and yes, even the bread I made yesterday. They were all slow processes involving trial and error, which ultimately made me capable of being and doing more.

Adopting a growth mindset has been instrumental in my journey. Otherwise, the first bug or snag I encountered while developing an application might have sent me packing. This blog is a perfect example. My initial goal was to utilize the Jekyll Midnight theme, but facing challenges hasn't deterred me. Instead, it's fueled my determination to find a solution, whether it's mastering the theme or crafting a custom dark mode. This approach mirrors my experiences in learning to rollerblade, drive, and even cook—initial struggles transformed into valuable skills.

I believe in the power of incremental progress. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will this website. It's about enjoying the process and celebrating small victories along the way.

### The journey continues ...

The journey of a developer, like any other journey, is a constant evolution. Balancing technical skills and personal growth is essential for long-term success (the latter more than you know). I've shared my experiences, hoping to inspire others to keep going and not give up on their their own paths of growth and discovery.
