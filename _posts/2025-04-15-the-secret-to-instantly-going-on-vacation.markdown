This is going to be a short post. 

I remember I went, a while back, to the beach at a relaxing resort. The resort had equidistant speakers playing the same relaxing vibes all throughout the property. It was amazing and very soothing. I really loved it. 

Today, at the office, while working I randomly ran into a playlist that featured sounds a lot like the music from the resort a while back. I enjoyed it and kept working while listening to the tunes. Work became a lot more enjoyable, but I thought nothing of it. 

Later in the day, I had to leave my desk to go see someone. I felt like I was floating. I have not experienced that feeling since my vacation way back when and it was nice. I did not make the connection instantly, but it was fairly obvious what happened. I forgot about it, but my brain associated this music, back then, to feelings of relaxing and rejuvenating. It does not know that I am at work. All the brain knows is that when I listen to this music it can switch to the parasympathetic nervous system. 

#### ðŸ¤” What does this mean?

While taking a vacation is useful and we should definitely take breaks, because our mind needs them, whenever we feel overwhelmed, we can find a trigger or something that reminds us of how we felt on vacation and get transported back. It won't be as effective as the vacation, but it will definitely help us become more relaxed and at ease. I still remember, earlier today, how I literally felt like I'm floating on those carpets, with not a care in the world. You could not convince me that I'm at work and I should be stressed. 

It was amazing and I really hope you get to experience it, too. I don't know what's the trigger for you, but you probably do. You probably have a certain sound that reminds you of vacation, whether it's bird sounds from when you went camping in the mountains, or the sound of a creek, or waves at a beach. Listen to whatever works for you, close your eyes,  and remember those feelings. Next, imagine you are there and stay in this moment for 5, 10 or 15 minutes. I am certain you will come back rejuvenated.

Try it and you might get addicted to it more than that morning cup-of-joe.
